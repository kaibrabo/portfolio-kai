## Explanation

Welcome to the world of Shippies!  This is the only resource used to promote the degradation of surf spots along coastlines around the world.  Surf Bums are welcome!

Shippies is a Reddit-forum project utilizing Ruby on Rails framework.  

My role was to design and implement a functional forum site that signs up new users, allowing comments, and favoriting of topics and posts.  

## Problem

There have been no community of freeloading surf seekers until now!  Shippies is free to download and share, but who would want to contribute to the content? Many people who sleep in a van and mooch wifi from the local starbucks.

Satire aside, this application has been optimized to run seemlessly with Ruby on Rails, an efficient MVC framwork with databases.  I have had to incorporate several Gems to boost functionality.  I used Devise for user authentication, Pundit for user authorization for user-specific content and features, and Rspec for testing our models and controllers.

This was this first time I have used Rspec to run tests.

## Solution

Shippies allows users a resource, to share content via posts, comment on posts, and even favoriting the best ones.  Each user has a database record of every post they create, the comments they leave, and what are their favorite posts!

## Results

Ruby on Rails enabled me to get a working application finished within a brief period.  This being my first full fledge application on the Rails framework, I was presented with learning another type of MVC framework than what I had previously learned with AngularJS on Chatta.

I would go on to build another Rails app, Wiki Waki, with many similar features.  


## Conclusion

I was underestimated the learning curve of Ruby on Rails.  This project is the first introduction to the OOP framework and RoR was relatively easy to read as the syntax was fluid.  Taking into consideration that I now know Ruby on Rails, it will be my most useful scripting language, and I will readily use on any new project.
