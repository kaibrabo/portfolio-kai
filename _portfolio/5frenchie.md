## Explanation

The Great RGB is a color guessing game where the player needs to figure out which color corresponds to the RGB (Red - Green - Blue) Values. This front-end project was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  

My role was to design and implement a functional color game that would allows users to choose between two levels of difficulty, eliminating choices after picked and create an overall fluid application.

## Problem

RGB Color values are a difficult technology to become acquainted with and know how to differentiate them.

The Great RGB game was created to help practice Red, Green, and Blue value combinations to become recognizable.  This game is great for colorists, photo editors and anyone who likes looking at colors.

## Solution

This application has been optimized to run seemlessly with HTML, CSS3 and Javascript.  


I had to set up to implement a way for the random color generator work for three color choices on "Easy" mode and six on the "Hard" mode.  When the game is finished, the player can reset the game or change the difficulty mode.

This was this first time I have used loops to generate RGB values.


## Conclusion

As a project that took me about four hours to complete, it was a great learning experience as a beginner in front-end development.
