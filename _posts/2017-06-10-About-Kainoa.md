October 4, 1991

I was born in Kauai, Hawaii to a filipino mother and a haole father.  I have two older brothers, Sam and Zach, who still live in Hawaii.  I also have two younger brothers, Kalani and Makana (Byron is his given name), Kalani is my current roommate and Makana still lives on Kauai with my grandparents.  My mother is a recovering drug addict who has been in a women's correctional facility in Oahu, HI for most of the past decade, and my father has been in and out of work for the Plumbers Union in San Francisco since my whole childhood.  

At this moment, I have a girlfriend, Flavia, very smart and sexy Brazilian woman and I have a french bulldog, Pele, named after the Hawaiian Volcano Goddess.  I share a two bedroom, one bath with my brother in the lower unit of a house owned and lived in by my grandmother.  We have a an optimal spot because of the proximity to the rest of the bay and the amenities San Rafael and Marin County offer.  

My brother and I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a popular martial art popularized by the Gracie Family.  I am also an avid mountain biker and photographer.
