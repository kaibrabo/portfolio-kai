title: Review (so far) of Colt Steele's Udemy Coding Bootcamp
---

In my previous blog post,  I explained that I took another online bootcamp.  To say it compares to Bloc, is like comparing Spanish class to living in Mexico.  

Colt Steele, a lead software engineer at Galvanize and Udacity, has a very affordable course on Udemy.com where he teaches you everything you need to get started as a fullstack web developer.  He has 'refined' what he believes is the essential programming languages and tools to learn for a successful career.  The beginning starts out by walking through HTML set up basics and CSS.  Then he transitions into javascript basics.  This is where I believe he was not very thorough because he simply can't teach enough logic in the short chapter.  There are too many ways on how to think about solving a problem, so it's best to read EloquentJavascript.net and practice solving challenges on Codewars.com.  

During each chapter, Colt has you build several small projects, nice fillers for the portfolio, and practice with syntax and customization.  I really enjoyed making the to-do list and the patatap game. After, Colt introduces C9, a cloud based Development Environment, where he teaches the foundations of Node.js and Express.
